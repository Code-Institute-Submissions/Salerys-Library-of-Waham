# Library of Waham

Library of Waham is a website made for author Alcor to share his works. The idea came from me writing novels and one-shot stories, and I always wanted a site, and plan to use this in the future and develope it further. The goal is to showcase teasers of some of my works and get the users interested in the site, and my works.

As of now, Library of Waham includes multiple teasers, a Gallery with commissioned concept art, and a working example of a question submit form.

## My Goals as the Site Owner

- To share my stories that I consider my "lifework" with others, hoping to bring joy to people.
- To inspire others to write, and have them submit questions on how to create their splendid ideas as written stories.
- To create a fan community and see people brainstorm about future chapters and arcs.
- In general, to spread love for fantasy stories.

## User Stories

- ### First time user

  - As a first time user I want to understand the main purpose of the site explore the stories written by the author.
  - As a first time user I want to be able to easily navigate through the website, and have a fun time browsing.
  - As a first time user I want to find new fantasy stories to read.

- ### Returning User

  - As a returning user I want to just quickly hop on the site and choose a story that fits my mood.  
  - As a returning user I want to be able to ask someone more experienced for writing tips and how-to suggestions.

- ### Frequent User

  - As a frequent user I want to join a fan community that can share opinions, guesses and things they like about the stories on the site.
  - As a frequent user I want to contribute to the future of the stories by giving ideas and suggestions to the author for the stories I like.

## Design

### Imagery

The imagery used on the Library of Waham site is very important to the overall experience of the user. Fantasy images fitting the teaser of the stories the user finds on the main page, as this is what grabs their interest at first.
Therefore the images used are fitting the lore of the story.
The images are pleasant to look at, giving a cozy feeling to the user.

### Colours

The colour scheme of the website is grey and orange, to keep it simple to not take any attention away from the displayed stories and their corresponding background photos. The contrast of the orange and grey along with the varying images give an attention-grabbing yet not too straining effect.

### Fonts

The Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif font family was used throughout the whole website. This font was already present using CodeAnywhere, and felt the most fitting from the ones present while creating this project.

## Wireframes

Wireframes were produced using Balsamiq.

## Testing

### Validator Testing

- #### HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C Markup Validator
    - [W3C Validator Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?useragent=Validator.nu%2FLV+http%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fservices&acceptlanguage=&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fsalerys.github.io%2FLibrary-of-Waham%2Findex.html)

- #### CSS
  - 3 errors found with the official W3C CSS Validator when using link input to check
  - No errors found with the official W3C CSS Validator when using direct input to check
  - I was informed upon asking, that I don't need to worry about the link input error, as I'm using the Code Institute template, and my ppt1 is running without problem.
    - [W3C CSS Validator Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fsalerys.github.io%2FLibrary-of-Waham%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)
    - ![CSS validator success image](docs/readme_img/css_validator_success.jpg)

- #### Accessibility
  - The site achieved a Lighthouse accessibility score of 90% which confirms that while a few improvements could be done with the buttons, the colours and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible

![Lighthouse score](docs/readme_img/lighthouse_ppt1.jpg)

### Form Testing

- The form has been tested to ensure it would not submit without the required input fields being filled in (full name and email address).

### Links Testing

- All navigation links were tested manually to ensure the user is directed to the correct section of the website.
- Social Media links in the footer of each page were tested manually to ensure they direct the user to the correct page and open in a new tab.

### Browser Testing

- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera GX browsers with no major issues noted.

### Device Testing

- The website was viewed on multiple devices to ensure responsiveness on various screen sizes. Everything performed as intended. The responsiveness was also checked using Chrome developer tools across multiple devices for the various sizes.
- I also used the following websites to test responsiveness:
  - [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsalerys.github.io%2FLibrary-of-Waham%2Findex.html)
  - [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://salerys.github.io/Library-of-Waham/index.html)
  - [AmIResponsive](https://amiresponsive.co.uk)

### Friends and Family User Testing

Friends and family members were asked to review the site to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Fixed Bugs

#### Home page section text out of intended area on smaller devices

- The three sections in index html ad their text got pushed out of the intended area (the papyrus image) on smaller devices, making the user experience unacceptable
- To solve this I created a media tag for the sections

#### Grid template: column for Gallery didn't work as intended

- When I first implemented Grid for the Gallery page I tried setting a template:column autofit minmax css code as previously showcased by our coordinator and course group members, which caused the page to look empty and unprofessional on bigger screen size.
- No matter how I tried, if I made it look as intended on bigger screen size, on phone devices it became scuffed, the images being wider than the body/header.
- Having consulted people we still haven't found the solution, so I have settled with deleting the minmaxing code line, changing the style to the current one, where the user has to scroll through the pictures.

### Known Bugs

- Implemented "_blank" code for Gallery images downloads the image instead of opening then on a new tab on certain browsers.

- During the CSS validation process, several parsing errors were reported. These errors are associated with the minified version of Bootstrap's CSS (version 5.3.2), which is an external library used in the project. Here's an overview of the identified issues:
  ![CSS validator bug image](docs/readme_img/css_validator_bug.jpg)
  

  - Bootstrap Parsing Errors: The CSS validator reported parsing errors in the Bootstrap library. As these errors are within an external, well-maintained library, they are beyond the scope of this project's direct codebase. Such parsing errors are known to occur in minified files where optimizations for size may result in unconventional syntax that doesn't affect functionality but may not pass strict validation.
  - It's important to note that these parsing errors do not impact the performance or visual rendering of the website. The Bootstrap library is widely used and tested, and the errors reported are recognized as false positives that do not indicate actual issues in the library's operation or the website's functionality.
While these errors are acknowledged, no action is required as they are part of the minified Bootstrap library and not a result of the project's custom CSS code.
